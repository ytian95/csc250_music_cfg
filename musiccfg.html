  <h1>Music Production with CFGs</h1>

  <h3 id="one">Introduction</h3>
  
  <p>With any form of art, there is a form and technique to how it is created and music is no different. Music theory is the study of the language of music and explaining the music we hear. From examinations of many pieces across many time periods, music theorists have distilled certain patterns that composers tend to follow that make music sound harmonically pleasant to the ear.</p>

<p>At a most basic level, music can be distilled to a set of patterns. These patterns can be modeled using different languages from the Chomsky hierarchy, we have chosen to focus on context free grammars (CFGs) to imitate basic music theory. Using CFGs to model musical progression is not a new; the idea itself is formed on the basis of linguistics. Instead of words and grammars, we have notes and musical grammars. A CFG can be used to create a structure in the underlying music. CFGs can be used to model composers who follow a certain style and pattern, such as Bach or Mozart. Grammars can also be used as an analytics tool or as a composing tool.

  <h4>Music Theory</h4> 
  <h4>Context Free Grammars</h4> 
      <p>A context free grammar (CFG) is a set of recursive rules (aka productions) that are used to generate patterns of strings. The language of a grammar is the set of strings it generates. A language is context-free if there is a CFG for it. Its formal definition can be described as a four tuple G = (N, Σ, R, S) where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>N is a set of non-terminal symbols, which serve as the placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols.</li>
        <li>Σ is a set of terminal symbols. There are the characters of the alphabet that are generated by the grammar.</li>
        <li>R is a set of rules of the form X → Y1Y2...Yn. Non-terminal symbols must be on the left side with other non-terminal or terminal symbols on the right side.</li>
        <li>S ∈ N is a specific start symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979)<br /><br />
          
          It is simply a grammar where the thing that you're replacing (left of the arrow) is a single "non-terminal" symbol. A non-terminal symbol is any symbol you use in the grammar that can't appear in your final strings.<br /><br />
          
          Here is an example:<br />
          <ul>
              <li>S → 0S1</li>
              <li>S → ε</li>
          </ul>
          The string 0011 is in the language generated.<br />
          The derivation followed is this: S =⇒ 0S1 =⇒ 00S11 =⇒ 0011
          <br /><br />
        *Note that to check a grammar and description match, one must check two things: that everything the grammar generates fits the description (consistency), and everything in the description is generated by the grammar (completeness).
        <br /><br />
        In the context of creating a model for music/composition, parametric grammars can be used as an extension of CFGs where non-terminals have parameters, small patterns of music, that take values in the set of terminals. These parameters play different roles in a piece according to the measure-level and/or phase-level to create various notions of development within musical sound. Overall, parametric grammars have the same expressiveness as context-free grammars but can be significantly more concise.
